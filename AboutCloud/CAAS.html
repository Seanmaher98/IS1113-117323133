                Gmail is Google's free email service. You can find Gmail at mail.google.com.If you have a Google account,
                you already have a Gmail account. Inbox is an optional upgraded user interface for Gmail accounts.
                Gmail became popular by giving users ample storage space. Rather than deleting old messages, you could archive them. Today Gmail storage space is shared across Google accounts including Google Drive. As of this writing,
                the free storage space is 15 gigs across all accounts, but you can buy additional storage space if necessary.</br></p></center>
