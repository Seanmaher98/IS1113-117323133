                <p>The AWS Cloud infrastructure is built around Regions and Availability Zones (AZs).
                AWS Regions provide multiple, physically separated and isolated Availability Zones which are connected with low latency,
                high throughput, and highly redundant networking. These Availability Zones offer AWS customers an easier and more effective way to design and operate applications and databases,
                making them more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single datacenter infrastructures or multi-datacenter infrastructures.
                For customers who specifically need to replicate their data or applications over greater geographic distances, there are AWS Local Regions.
                An AWS Local Region is a single datacenter designed to complement an existing AWS Region. Like all AWS Regions, AWS Local Regions are completely isolated from other AWS Regions.
                The AWS Cloud spans 53 Availability Zones within 18 AWS Regions and one Local Region around the world.</p></center>
