                    <p>Software as a Service or SaaS is a way of delivering applications over the Internet â€“ as a service.
                    Also known as cloud software, ASP, on-demand software or hosted software.
                    The first applications for consumers were things like webmail, bookmarking and photo sharing.
                    In business, things like recruitment, expenses and customer relationship management were among the early innovations.
                    SaaS has since become a widely-used business model with more and more different kinds of applications available via the cloud.</p></center>
