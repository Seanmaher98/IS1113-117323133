    <p>Cloud storage is a term that refers to online space that you can use to store your data.
    As well as keeping a backup of your files on physical storage devices such as external hard drives or USB flash drives,
    cloud storage provides a secure way to remotely store your important data. Online storage solutions are usually provided 
    using a large network of virtual servers that come with tools for managing files and organizing your virtual storage space.</p>


    <h3>How Cloud Storage Works</h3>
    <p>The simplest type of cloud storage occurs when users upload files and folders on their computers or mobile devices to an internet server.
    The uploaded files serve as a backup in case the original files are damaged or lost. Using a cloud server permits the user to download files
    to other devices when needed. The files are typically protected by encryption and are accessed by the user with login credentials and password.
    The files are always available to the user, as long as the user has an internet connection to view or retrieve them.</p>
