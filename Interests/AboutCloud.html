        <h1>What is Cloud Storage?</h1>
    
        <body>
    
        <p>Cloud storage is a term that refers to online space that you can use to store your data.
        As well as keeping a backup of your files on physical storage devices such as external hard drives or USB flash drives,
        cloud storage provides a secure way to remotely store your important data. Online storage solutions are usually provided 
        using a large network of virtual servers that come with tools for managing files and organizing your virtual storage space.</p>

        <h3>How Cloud Storage Works</h3>
        
        <p>The simplest type of cloud storage occurs when users upload files and folders on their computers or mobile devices to an internet server.
        The uploaded files serve as a backup in case the original files are damaged or lost. Using a cloud server permits the user to download files
        to other devices when needed. The files are typically protected by encryption and are accessed by the user with login credentials and password.
        The files are always available to the user, as long as the user has an internet connection to view or retrieve them.</p>

        <h3>Advantages of Cloud Storage</h3>

        <p>1.Usability: 
        All cloud storage services reviewed in this topic have desktop folders for Mac's and PC's.
        This allows users to drag and drop files between the cloud storage and their local storage.<br>

        2.Bandwidth:
        You can avoid emailing files to individuals and instead send a web link to recipients through your email.<br>

        3.Accessibility:
        Stored files can be accessed from anywhere via Internet connection.<br>

        4.Disaster Recovery:
        It is highly recommended that businesses have an emergency backup plan ready in the case of an emergency.
        Cloud storage can be used as a back-up plan by businesses by providing a second copy of important files.
        These files are stored at a remote location and can be accessed through an internet connection.<br>

        5.Cost Savings:
        Businesses and organizations can often reduce annual operating costs by using cloud storage;
        cloud storage costs about 3 cents per gigabyte to store data internally.
        Users can see additional cost savings because it does not require internal power to store information remotely.</p><br>
        
        
        <h3>Disadvantages of Cloud Storage</h3>
        
        <p>1.Usability:
        Be careful when using drag/drop to move a document into the cloud storage folder.
        This will permanently move your document from its original folder to the cloud storage location.<br>

        2.Bandwidth:
        Several cloud storage services have a specific bandwidth allowance.
        If an organization surpasses the given allowance, the additional charges could be significant.
        However, some providers allow unlimited bandwidth. This is a factor that companies should consider when looking at a cloud storage provider.<br>

        3.Accessibility:
        If you have no internet connection, you have no access to your data.<br>
        
        4:Data Security:
        There are concerns with the safety and privacy of important data stored remotely.
        The possibility of private data commingling with other organizations makes some businesses uneasy.<br>
        
        5.Software:
        If you want to be able to manipulate your files locally through multiple devices,
        you'll need to download the service on all devices.</p><br>
